              I'm a passionate frontend developer with over 5 years of experience 
              creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered digital experiences. 
              I specialize in React, JavaScript, and modern web technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              My approach combines technical expertise with a keen eye for design, 
              ensuring that every project not only works flawlessly but also provides 
              an exceptional user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends, 
              contributing to open source projects, or sharing knowledge with the 
              developer community.
